# ARL-unbiased-Fixed-Service-Rate-Wn-chart
This R code implements ARL-unbiased Wn (Fixed Service Rate) control charts for monitoring Ek/M/1 and M/Ek/1 queueing systems. It provides functions to compute ARL with and without randomization, allowing control limit and randomization probabilities detection in queueing systems. The code also includes interactive plotting via Shiny
